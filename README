--Installation--
will require pip install pygame + PILLOW

- try in terminal
pip install pygame pillow

--Controls--
w = north/up
a = west/left
s = south/down
d = east/right
m = open/close map

left click on buttons to use

--Goal--
none so far meant to be turned based but didn't have time due to tkinter's complexity to seeming trivial tasks.

--Important Notes--
- game is not saved, closing the window will reset all progress
- game is not meant to be completed, just a demo of a text based adventure game with some rpg elements
- some areas are not fully implemented and will not spawn enemies
- items are not implemented nor the equipment system
