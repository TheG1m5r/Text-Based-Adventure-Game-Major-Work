Jagged rocks and sparse, charred vegetation dot the area, hinting at the harsh conditions that dominate this fiery terrain.",
    "volcano_2": "You stand on the slopes of an active volcano, where the ground trembles beneath your feet. The air is hot and filled with the scent of sulfur, while occasional bursts of smoke and ash rise from the crater above. The landscape is rugged, with hardened lava flows and sparse vegetation struggling to survive in this volatile environment.",
    "volcano_1": "The volcano looms above, its peak shrouded in smoke. The ground is uneven and rocky, with patches of hardened lava and sparse, resilient plants. The air is warm and carries the faint scent of sulfur, reminding you of the volcano's dormant power.",
    "tundra_1": "The tundra stretches out before you, a vast expanse of flat, treeless land covered in a mix of grasses, mosses, and lichens. The ground is often frozen, with patches of snow and ice lingering even in warmer months. The air is crisp and cold, carrying the faint scent of earth and distant water.",
    "tundra_2": "The tundra is a stark, open landscape where low-lying vegetation like mosses, lichens, and hardy grasses dominate. The ground is often frozen, with patches of snow and ice persisting year-round. The air is cold and dry, with a clear, expansive sky overhead.",
    "tundra_mountain_tops": "The mountain tops rise sharply, their peaks capped with snow and ice. The air is thin and cold, making each breath a challenge. Jagged rocks and sparse alpine vegetation cling to the slopes, while the view stretches out to reveal the vast tundra below.",
    "forest_1": "Tall trees rise around you, their dense canopy blotting out much of the sky. Shafts of light pierce through the leaves, illuminating patches of moss and tangled roots. The air is cool and damp, carrying the earthy scent of soil and distant foliage. Every soundâ€”whether a birdcall or the snap of a twigâ€”seems to echo deeper than it should.",
    "forest_2": "You find yourself in a dense forest where towering trees with thick trunks and lush canopies create a shaded, almost mystical atmosphere. The ground is carpeted with fallen leaves, moss, and ferns, while the air is filled with the earthy scent of damp wood and foliage. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor.",
    "village": "You enter a quaint village nestled among rolling hills and surrounded by lush forests. Cobblestone streets wind between charming cottages with thatched roofs and colorful gardens. The air is filled with the sounds of daily lifeâ€”children playing, merchants calling out their wares, and the distant clatter of horse-drawn carts. The scent of fresh bread and blooming flowers adds to the village's welcoming atmosphere.",
    "ocean_1": "You stand on a sandy beach where the waves gently lap at the shore. The ocean stretches out endlessly before you, its surface shimmering under the sunlight. Seagulls call overhead, and the salty breeze carries the invigorating scent of the sea. The beach is dotted with seashells and smooth stones, while distant ships sail on the horizon.",
    "ocean_2": "The ocean is a vast expanse of deep blue, with waves that rise and fall rhythmically. The salty air is filled with the cries of seabirds, and the scent of seaweed and brine is strong. The horizon seems to stretch infinitely, where the sky meets the water in a seamless blend of colors. Occasional glimpses of marine life, like dolphins or seabirds diving, add to the ocean's dynamic beauty.",
    "ocean_depths": "Beneath the surface, the ocean depths are a mysterious and otherworldly realm. Sunlight barely penetrates the dark waters, creating an eerie twilight where strange and colorful creatures glide silently. Coral reefs teem with life, while larger predators move in the shadows. The water is cool and filled with the scent of salt and the faint hum of underwater currents."

##### random ass bug i just found after not touching the code for hours that i don't have time to try to fix,
##### where the next screen when moving with wasd (idk if buttons work) it won't open the screen unless you encounter an enemy
##### also you can encounter an enemy when opening and closing the map... but it could be considered a feature so idc
